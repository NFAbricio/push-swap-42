# Libft

## Description

Libft is the first project of the 42 curriculum. Its objective is to recreate a selection of standard C library functions while developing a deeper understanding of memory management, pointers, strings, and data structures.

The project consists of building a custom C library that can be reused in future 42 projects. In addition to reproducing functions from the standard library, Libft also introduces additional utility functions and a linked list API.

### Goal

The main goals of this project are:

* Understand how common C library functions work internally.
* Practice memory allocation and management.
* Improve proficiency with pointers and data manipulation.
* Build a reusable personal library for future projects.
* Learn the fundamentals of linked lists.

### Overview

The library includes:

* Character classification functions.
* String manipulation functions.
* Memory manipulation functions.
* Conversion functions.
* Dynamic memory allocation helpers.
* File descriptor output functions.
* Singly linked list functions (Bonus Part).

## Instructions

### Requirements

* GCC or Clang compiler
* Make
* Unix/Linux environment

### Compilation

Compile the library using:

```bash
make
```

This generates the static library:

```text
libft.a
```

### Available Rules

```bash
make        # Build libft.a
make clean  # Remove object files
make fclean # Remove object files and libft.a
make re     # Rebuild everything
```

### Using the Library

Include the header in your source file:

```c
#include "libft.h"
```

Compile your program with the library:

```bash
cc main.c libft.a
```

Or:

```bash
cc main.c -L. -lft
```

### AI Usage

Artificial Intelligence tools were used as learning aids during the development of this project. Their usage included:

* Clarifying concepts related to pointers, memory management, and linked lists.
* Understanding the behavior of standard C library functions.
* Reviewing code explanations and debugging strategies.
* Assisting in the preparation of project documentation.

All code was manually written, tested, and validated by the author.
